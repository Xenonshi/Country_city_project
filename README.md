# Country_city_project
Turn a bunch of cities to its belonging countries

We have around 200k rows of people birth places data. We want to convert those place names to its country level.

The birth places data is a bit messy. We need to clean it a bit.

e.g. 
France -> France
Paris -> France (despite there are a lot of Paris on the planet, we will use the city with the highest population)


French -> France
Londoner -> London -> England -> UK

MD -> Maryland -> US
